# Introductory Bioinformatics Resources for Biologists
A collection of resources targeted towards biologists looking to enter the computational side of the field. Therefore extensive biology knowledge but limited programming knowledge is assumed. The sequence of resources moves along the spectrum starting at biostatistics and ending with more in-depth bioinformatics algorithms and engineering concepts.
